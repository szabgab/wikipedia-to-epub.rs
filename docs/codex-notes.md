# Codex Session Notes

## 2026-05-24

### Summary

This session focused on expanding Wikipedia template rendering for EPUB output, updating expected integration fixtures, and documenting the conversion behavior.

### Decisions Made

* Template handling should happen through the shared `{{...}}` parser, with only unhandled templates logged.
* Metadata or maintenance templates are skipped silently when they should not appear in EPUB output.
* Language-specific templates should render EPUB-friendly HTML using `lang` attributes where appropriate.
* Known Korean transliteration templates are rendered directly instead of leaking template syntax into the book.
* `harvc` is treated as a compact chapter/contribution citation; EPUB output keeps the contributor, quoted contribution title, enclosing source key/year, and optional page/location details.
* `As of` is rendered as visible prose, preserving the capitalization option `lc=y` and basic year/month/day date forms.
* `Blockquote` is rendered as block-level XHTML with quote text in `<blockquote><p>...` and optional source text in `p.blockquote-source`.
* `Further` is rendered as visible hatnote-style prose: `Further information:` plus article links, with `topic=` becoming `Further information about ...:`.
* Wikipedia succession-box templates whose names start with `s-` are treated as navigation/metadata and skipped silently.
* The README should describe conversion rules with concrete before/after examples.

### Files Changed

* `src/main.rs`
  * Added or extended rendering for templates including `ill`, `Reign`, `lang`, `langx`, `Percentage`, `UN Population`, `Korean/auto`, `Ko-translit`, `Cite report`, `harvc`, `As of`, `Blockquote`, and `Further`.
  * Added block-level handling for rendered blockquote markers so quotes are not flattened into ordinary paragraphs.
  * Updated citation author collection so unnumbered `last`/`first` can combine correctly with numbered coauthors such as `last2`/`first2`.
  * Added silent skipping for templates such as `Redirect`, `pp-semi-indef`, `Sfn`, `efn`, and succession templates prefixed with `s-`.
  * Added tests for template rendering behavior, including the restored example fixture and Korean transliteration cases.
* `README.md`
  * Added notes describing wiki-to-HTML conversion rules and template rendering examples.
* `expected/korea/OEBPS/chapter-1.xhtml`
  * Updated the Korea fixture so visible `As of 2023` prose is preserved.
* `expected/korea/OEBPS/chapter-2.xhtml`
  * Updated the Seoul fixture so visible `As of`, `Further`, and blockquote prose is preserved.
* `expected/korea/OEBPS/chapter-3.xhtml`
  * Updated the Sejong fixture after citation-template and blockquote rendering changed the generated EPUB output.
* `src/tests.rs`
  * Added unit coverage for `Cite report`, `harvc`, `As of`, `Blockquote`, `Further`, and silent `s-` template handling.

### Tests Run

* `cargo test generate_korea_book_from_local_page_dumps`
* `cargo test render_wikitext_silently_skips_metadata_templates`
* `cargo test render_wikitext_formats_blockquote_templates`
* `cargo test render_wikitext_formats_further_templates`
* `cargo test --test books`
* `cargo test`

Latest verification passed:

* 45 unit tests passed.
* 4 local book integration tests passed.
* 1 real Wikipedia API test remains ignored by default.

### Pending Follow-Ups

* Broaden template support as new unhandled templates appear in source pages.
* Keep expected EPUB fixtures synchronized whenever rendering behavior intentionally changes.
* Consider adding more README examples for newly supported templates when their behavior becomes user-visible.
